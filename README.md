# PyLab
## Setup
### 1 - Setup the PyLab package
In this step, we’ll download “PyLab”, which is a collection of scripts that we’ll use to learn and practice programming in Python. It also includes the installers for Python and VS Code and a setup script to configure your environment for development.
1. Download the latest [PyLab deployment](.packaged/PyLab.zip) from the repository.

2. Place the PyLab zip file in a folder of your choice (preferably under your user folder) and extract the files.

3. (Optional) Delete the zip file once you’ve extracted the files from it.

4. Double-click on the setup.bat file inside the PyLab folder.
    * This will download and run the installers for __Python 3.13__, __7-Zip__, and __Visual Studio Code__. Follow the default setup instructions.

    * After the installers, the script will do more Python-related setup. Once the setup is completed, press any key to close the terminal.

    * Setup is now complete, we’re almost ready to run some code.
  

### 2 - Configure Visual Studio Code
#### 2.1 - Open Visual Studio Code
You should now be able to search for and open Visual Studio Code from your taskbar.

#### 2.2 - Install the Python extension
Installing the Python extension for Visual Studio Code will let Visual Studio Code run and debug your Python scripts and will provide handy features like auto-complete, syntax colouring, and highlighting errors and warnings as you type code
* Launch Visual Studio Code.
* Go to the extensions tab in the left-hand bar and search for “Python”.
* Click the “Install” button on the extension simply titled ”Python”.
* Once the extension installation is complete, close Visual Studio Code.</br></br><img width="660" height="600" alt="VSCode Python extension screenshot" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c4998adf-076b-408b-8524-aab763914c1a" />

#### 2.3 - Test your dev environment
Let’s open PyLab in Visual Studio Code and make sure we can run our scripts properly.
* Double-click the `PyLab.bat` file in your PyLab folder.

* You will be presented with a list of options. Choose `1. Open lessons` options by typing __1__ and pressing __Enter__.</br></br><img width="1115" height="322" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/be9d84a9-f583-486e-a437-9cddfdc3e0b1" />

* This will open basic Python lessons in Visual Studio Code. From the explorer tab in the left-hand bar, select the file __lessons > Stage 1 - The Basics of Python > Level 01 - Printing > example.py__</br></br><img width="1207" height="800" alt="Untitled" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3c1fe9b1-c228-4e1f-b577-fa71f37a05bb" />

* Open the dropdown next to the “Play” button in the top-right and select the “__Python Debugger: Debug Python File__” option</br></br><img width="1200" height="800" alt="Untitled" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5b569021-d631-47ac-9469-4df95cf942e1" />

* Visual Studio Code should switch to the Terminal view in the bottom pane and should print the message “Hello World!”.</br></br><img width="1200" height="800" alt="Untitled" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/db8f521f-95d7-43a0-93ff-98a3652f1a92" />

### 3 - Have Fun!
You’re now ready to start programming in Python! Happy learning!
