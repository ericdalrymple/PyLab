# ======= LEVEL 1: Comments and Printing ======= #
# ============================================== #

# Welcome to programming! In programming, we give the computer some instructions and it will do them one at a time.

# You can write comments in your code by starting a line with '#'. This turns the line into a comment and
# the computer will know that the line is not an instruction.

# ================================================================================================== #

# To begin, let's learn how to tell the computer to write something using the 'print' instruction!

# The line below tells the computer to write the message 'Hello world'.
print("Hello world!")
