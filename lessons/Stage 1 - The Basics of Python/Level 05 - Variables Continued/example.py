# ============================================ #

# VARIABLES can have all kinds of VALUES, but here are a few useful ones to keep in mind:

# Whole numbers
whole = 10

# Decimal numbers
decimal = 3.14

# Negative numbers
negative = -9.8

# Text
text = "Value"

# True-or-False
trueOrFalse = True

# You can also save the VALUE of an existing VARIABLE to another VARIABLE
variable = decimal

# Let's print these variables to see what the computer thinks they are
print("whole:", whole)
print("decimal:", decimal)
print("negative:", negative)
print("text:", text)
print("trueOrFalse", trueOrFalse)
print("variable:", variable)

# We can save a new VALUE to a VARIABLE even if we saved one before
variable = negative
print("variable (new):", variable)
