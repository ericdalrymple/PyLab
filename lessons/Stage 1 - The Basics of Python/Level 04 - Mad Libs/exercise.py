# EXERCISE:
#
#   By now, we learned how to do these things:
#       - Save VALUES in VARIABLES      (Level 02)
#       - Print VARIABLES               (Level 02 | Level 04)
#       - Ask questions to the player   (Level 03)
#       - Print many things in a row    (Level 04)
#
#   So let's try to use the things we learned to write a Mad Libs game!
#
#   In this programe, ask the player to enter these types of words:
#       A) An animal
#       B) An emotion
#       C) A place
#       D) A color
#       E) A vehicle
#       F) An emotion
#       G) An adjective
#       H) An object
#       I) A nickname
#
#   Change the print instruction below so that the player's answers become part of the story. You
#   can replace the words between <> by the player's answers.
#

print("The <A> felt very <B> to be going to <C> on a <D> <E>. They were very <F> to go there to get a(n) <G> <H> for <I>.")
