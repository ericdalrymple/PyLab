What is programming/coding?

    Asking a computer to do something by giving it instructions.

    Computers can understand instructions when they are written in programming languages.

    Python is the language that we will use to give the computer instructions, but there are many other programming languages that exist.

    Instructions can be very simple like "add two numbers together", or "print some text", but instructions can be combined to make very
    compicated things like calculating the path of a rocket going to space.
